# CP-Net: Multi-Scale Core Point Localization in Fingerprints Using Hourglass Network

This repository contains code for CP-Net, a deep learning model that combines a U-Net based architecture MLN (Macro-Localization Network) and a CNN based architecture MRN (Micro-Regression Network). The pretrained models can be downloaded from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x4F7uxXCDTe2Y6WiMkIeJQsQsVPm7ROJ?usp=share_link).
